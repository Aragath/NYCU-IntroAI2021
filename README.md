### 8-Puzzle

Used MCTS to implement an game agent that auto-plays the board game "Battle Sheep"

### CNN Classifier

Used Reinforment Learning to implement an game agent that auto-plays the classic game "Pacman"

### Decision Tree & Random Forest

Participated in the KORE2022 Competition on Kaggle, using Reinforment Learning and Rule-Based method to implement the game agent

### K-Means Clustering

Implement k-means algorithm on MNIST from scratch

### Final Project

Did experiments of face recognition using HOG and CNN
